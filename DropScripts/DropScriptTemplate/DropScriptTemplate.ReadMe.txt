## What it does

... Explain what it does ...

## Configuration

... explain the config file options ...

### acceptFileNameExtensions

Optional. The script will ignore any files whose file name does not end in one of the listed extensions

The default when this is omitted is:

    "acceptFileNameExtensions": [ "html", "htm", "xhtml" ]

### backupFileNameExtension

Optional. The file name extension to use for backup files

The default when this is omitted is:

    "backupFileNameExtension": "old"

### logLevel

Set to 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Depending on the number, more or less logging information will be
provided. Useful for diagnostics when the script does not seem to work correctly.

The default when this is omitted is:

    "logLevel": 0

### maxBackupCount

Optional. How many backup files to keep.

The default when this is omitted is:

    "maxBackupCount": 5

If maxBackupCount is 0, no backups are made

If maxBackupCount is greater than zero the backups will be

    SomeFile.xhtml ->
        SomeFile.xhtml.old
        SomeFile.xhtml_1.old
        SomeFile.xhtml_2.old
        ...
        SomeFile.xhtml_5.old

The SomeFile.xhtml.old is special: once made, it is never overwritten. It
stores the content of the original file from before you ran the script for the 
first time.

SomeFile.xhtml_1.old, SomeFile.xhtml_2.old... rotate. The _1 file is the latest,
the _5 file is the oldest.
